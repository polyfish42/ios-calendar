# ios-calendar

## Todo
- [ ] The UI should have one month hard coded view (Pick any month)
- [ ] Ignore users/login, just have one hardcoded user
- [ ] Click on a day box, and be able to create a new event on that day which gets sent to the backend on clicking submit. 
- [ ] The form should have start time, end time, description and submit. 
- [ ] Once submit is clicked the form should disappear.
- [ ] Event should now appear in that day’s box.
- [ ] Events cannot span multiple days. Must start and end the same day.
- [ ] Show all events the user has on their calendar.
- [ ] The UI should have 4 rows of 7 boxes (simple case of a 28 day month).
- [ ] The application should communicate with an API backend using JSON. Don’t spend a lot of time on the UI making it look beautiful; just make it functional.

Optional
- [ ] Switch between months
- [ ] Week or day view
- [ ] Handle events spanning multiple days
- [ ] Handle too many events to fit in your box UI on a given day.
- [ ] You should be able to update/delete events. How you implement this UX is up to you.
- [ ] The UI should have 5 rows of 7 boxes with the correct date on the correct days.
